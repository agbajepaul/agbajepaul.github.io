I am a Computer Science Ph.D. student at the [University of Texas at Arlington](https://www.uta.edu) and a part of the [Cyber-Physical Systems Security Lab](https://csslab.uta.edu) led by [Dr. Habeeb Olufowobi](https://dipupo.github.io). I develop tools and frameworks to uncover vulnerabilities in machine learning systems, with a primary focus on the security, privacy, and efficiency of models, particularly graph-based approaches. I extend this work to safety-critical domains such as vehicular systems, where I study both the attack surfaces of in-vehicle networks and strategies for resource-efficient edge AI. My broader goal is to advance resilient, secure, and adaptive intelligent infrastructures. Beyond cyber-physical systems, I also explore applications of AI in healthcare and materials science, including explainability methods for health AI and techniques to extract microstructural fingerprints from complex data.
